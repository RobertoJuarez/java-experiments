= Java Experiments

Java Experiments is a project for this and that which may be interesting in Java.

Though most of the modules of this project use SpringBoot many of the features tested in this experiments do
not require Spring nor any other framework ( using Spring Boot is also a way to experiment with
SpringBoot ). You just need a proper Java Development Kit.
